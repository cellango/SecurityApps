# Contributing to Application Security Score Card

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Application Security Score Card as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Document functions and classes using docstrings
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black formatter)

### JavaScript (Frontend)
- Use ESLint with Prettier
- Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prop types validation for all components

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with any new API endpoints or changes
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. When proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project
